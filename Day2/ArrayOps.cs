/*
Write a program that allows you to create an integer array of 
18 elements with the following values: 
int A[]={3,2,4,5,6,4,5,7,3,2,3,4,7,1,2,0,0,0}. 
The program computes the sum of element 0 to 14 and stores it at 
element 15, computes the average and stores it at element 16 and 
identifies the smallest value from the array and stores it at element 17.
